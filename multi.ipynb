    "Q1. Multiprocessing in Python\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the capability of creating and running multiple processes concurrently in order to execute tasks. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, allowing true parallelism by utilizing multiple CPUs or CPU cores.\n",
    "Usefulness:\n",
    "Parallelism: Utilizes multiple CPU cores or CPUs to perform computations concurrently, thereby improving performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Fault Isolation: Processes run in separate memory spaces, reducing the risk of one process affecting another in case of errors or crashes.\n",
    "Scaling: Facilitates scaling of applications to handle larger workloads efficiently.\n",
    "Q2. Differences between Multiprocessing and Multithreading\n",
    "Multiprocessing:\n",
    "Involves running multiple processes concurrently.\n",
    "Each process has its own memory space.\n",
    "Ideal for CPU-bound tasks or tasks requiring true parallelism.\n",
    "Takes advantage of multiple CPU cores or CPUs.\n",
    "Multithreading:\n",
    "Involves running multiple threads within the same process.\n",
    "Threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "Suitable for I/O-bound tasks or tasks where threads can perform independently but within the same memory context.\n",
    "Limited by Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, limiting true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Q3. Creating a Process Using multiprocessing Module\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",

    "Q4. Multiprocessing Pool in Python\n",
    "Multiprocessing Pool:\n",
    "The multiprocessing.Pool class in Python provides a way to distribute work across multiple processes (a pool of worker processes).\n",
    "It simplifies parallel execution by managing a pool of worker processes, allowing tasks to be dispatched to these workers.\n",
    "Use:\n",
    "Efficiently manages and distributes tasks to a pool of worker processes.\n",
    "Controls the number of worker processes, manages communication, and gathers results asynchronously.\n",
    "Q5. Creating a Pool of Worker Processes\n",

    "    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=3) as pool:\n",
    "        # Apply function asynchronously to the data\n",
    "        result = pool.map(square_number, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "multiprocessing.Pool(processes=3) creates a pool of 3 worker processes.\n",
    "pool.map(square_number, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) applies the square_number function to each element in the list using the pool's worker processes.\n",

    "We create 4 processes using multiprocessing.Process.\n",
    "Each process prints a different number along with its process ID.\n",
    "process.start() starts each process, and process.join() waits for each process to complete before the program exits.\n"
